This is a basic single view app.
In this project, I produced an application that lets users scroll through a list of images, then select one to view, and allow users to share images with their friends

Here are just some of the things I've covered: table views and image views, app bundles, FileManager, typecasting, view controllers, storyboards, outlets, Auto Layout, UIImage, UIBarButtonItem, UIActivityViewController, and more.
